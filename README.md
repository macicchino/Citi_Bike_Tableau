## Purpose 

The purpose of this analysis is to vizualize Citi Bike data for NYC using Tableau. Using Tableau allows you to easily construct stylized charts and graphs from a dataset. However, it is mainly a visualization tool. So we first clean the data in python using pandas dataframes. 

## Data Preparation

First using jupyter notebook, python, and pandas. We cleaned the dataset and convert the tripduration variable to a DateTime data type. 

## Analysis
